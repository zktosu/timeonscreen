# timeonscreen
A simple mac tool to show total screen on time (hours) on battery since given charged time.

to use simply change the "txt" time and timezone for yourself.

on terminal run or build then run this code.

Please note: If you know or find a way to get the last unplugged event from macos please message me so that I can make this script to be able to run without interference with code.
